Add maps to your posts or pages, embed Microformat Geo or Adr, and output GeoRSS and KML. 

== Description ==

GeoPress adds geographic tagging of your posts and pages. You can enter an address, points on a map, or enter latitude & longitude using the post interface. You can also include the post location within the body itself to make it easy to geotag using emailed posts and desktop clients. Maps can be Google, Microsoft, OpenStreetMap, 3D globe, or any major mapping provider by using the Mapstraction mapping library.  Makes your feeds GeoRSS compatible, and also adds KML for viewing in Google Earth.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do i make my RSS feed publish lat/long? =
Make sure "Enable GeoRSS tags in feeds" is checked in the GeoPress options. Everything else is added for you automatically.

= How do i insert a map into my content? =
A: First enter in a location for your post. After that, insert this text "INSERT_MAP" (without the quotes) where you want the image tag for the map included within your post text while editing the post. A map centered at the post's location & with a star showing the location will appear.
